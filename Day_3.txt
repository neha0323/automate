1) Xpath will always start with //
2) Remember the syntax: //tag[@attribute='value']
3) Xpath using single attribute:
	a. Login button on FB
	b. //input[@value='Log In']
	c. We can use any attribute value but xpath should be unique
	d. Always check attribute which looks static like the value of id in Login button on FB
4) Xpath using multiple attributes with OR condition:
	a. First Name field on FB
	b. //input[@name='firstname' or aria-label='First name']
	c. If any one of the attrbute value is correct then this will work
	d. OR is case sensitive. It should be in lower case always.
	e. We can use any number of attributes
5) Xpath using multiple attributes with AND condition:
	a. Date of birth field on FB
	b. //select[@name='birthday_day' and @title='Day']
	c. All the attributes should have correct value
	d. AND is case sensitive. It should be in lower case always.
	e. We can use any number of attributes
6) Xpath using * in place of attribute or tag name:
	a. //select[@*='birthday_day' and @*='Day']
	b. //*[@*='birthday_day' and @*='Day']
	c. This method is not recommended
	d. * denotes anywhere in DOM
	e. Email or phone example - //*[@*='email']
7) Xpath using innertext:
	a. If all attributes have dynamic value then go for innertext
	b. 'Create a new account' text on FB
	c. Syntax: //tag[text()='value']
	d. //div[text()='Create a new account']
	e. Use complete and exact text
8) Xpath using partial innertext:
	a. Text can be dynamic and can be changed by developer. If this is the case we will see, what part is atatic and will use it
	b. Syntax: //tag[contains(text(),'value')]
	c. //div[contains(text(),'new account')]
9) Xpath with partial value of attribute:
	a. Syntax: //tag[contains(@attribute,'partial value')]
	b. //input[contains(@type,'pass')]
10) Xpath using parent of the element:
	a. We will use this approach if we are not able to locate an elemnt using any of the above mentioned techniques because all attributes of the element are dynamic
	b. Always take that parent which has attributes and at least one of them is static 
	c. Email or phone field on FB
	d. '/' means child
	e. //table[@role='presentation']/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/input
11) Xpath using child of the element:
	a. Locate table on FB
	b. //input[@type='email']/parent::td/parent::tr/parent::tbody/parent::table
12) Xpath using siblings of the element:
	a. Elements which are on same level or in other words, elements having common parent are siblings
	b. //a[@title='Live Cricket Score']/following-sibling::a[1] - Cricbuzz
	c. Replace 'following' with 'preceding' if element we are looking for is above the sibling
13) Xpath using parent, child and siblings (all at once):
	a. Locate password field on FB using username field
	b. //input[@id='email']/parent::td/following-sibling::td[1]/input
	c. Task - Find username through password
